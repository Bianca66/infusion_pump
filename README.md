In this project, it is desired to design a syringe pump for drug delivery and sampling/drainage of intracavitary fluids. The mechanism is based on a lead screw mechanism driven by a bipolar stepper motor controlled by an Arduino board. The control panel consists on a keypad, to set the infusion parameters. The data output is visualized through an alphanumeric display (Liquid Crystal Display â€“ LCD). This display shows the information on the infusion in course, the total volume to be infused, the flow rate (ml/min).
The 3D model of the system purge was made in AutoCAD, using the dimensions of the standard syringes. AutoCAD is a computer-aided graphics and design environment, produced and marketed by the American company Autodesk. It is a CAD program successfully used in fields such as architecture, medicine, and technology.
