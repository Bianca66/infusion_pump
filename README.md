# Developing the drive system of a syringe infusion pump for drug delivery and blood sampling

Continuous and slow administration of medications such as analgesics, cytostatics, thrombolytics, anesthetics, as well as parietal fluids or nutrients is essential for patients with complex and/or chronic diseases because any change in infusion rate, by only a few ml per hour, can have dramatic effects for an emergent patient. Therefore, it is necessary to use an automatic drug infusion system that allows the possibility of adjusting the specific parameters of the infusion rate and the administration of medical fluids continuously, for a long time, with high accuracy.

In this project, it is desired to design a syringe pump for drug delivery and sampling/drainage of intracavitary fluids. This module allows the possibility of use injector as an infusion pump or as a suction pump for collecting various biological samples such as blood, plasma, lymph or intracavitary fluids. This would be an advantage in terms of cost, time of preparation, and use of the device in the hospital or outpatient. The mechanism is based on a lead screw mechanism driven by a bipolar stepper motor controlled by an Arduino board. The control panel consists on a keypad, to set the infusion parameters. The data output is visualized through an alphanumeric display (Liquid Crystal Display â€“ LCD). This display shows the information on the infusion in course, the total volume to be infused, the flow rate (ml/min).

The infusion and suction system was implemented using a nut screw mechanism driven by a 42shdc4043z-22b bipolar stepper motor, controlled by an Arduino board.
